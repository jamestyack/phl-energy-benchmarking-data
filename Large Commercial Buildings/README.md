##Energy Benchmarking Data (Large Commercial Buildings)

##Summary
This dataset contains building and performance data for those properties which reported during Year Two of the energy benchmarking and disclosure program, which covered the 2013 calendar year. Property data is pulled from the Office of Property Assessment. Data is self-reported by building owners using the EPA Portfolio Manager tool.  This data will be updated annually.

Data Dictionary
---------------

| Field |	Description |
|---|---|
| Portfolio Manager ID:  | This is a unique ID assigned by the Portfolio Manager tool to each property. |
| Property Name: | Name of property as reported by property owner. |
| Address :	| Location of property. |
| Postal Code: |	Zip code of property address. |
| Primary Property Type - EPA Calculated:	| EPA calculates a property type based on the property uses that you enter. This is the property type that accounts for more than 50% of your property. If no individual property type accounts for more than 50%, then it is designated as Mixed Use. |
| Property Floor Area (Buildings and Parking):	| Property floor area (ft²) is the gross floor area of the property including parking.  Gross floor area is the total size, as measured between the principal exterior surfaces of the enclosing fixed walls of the building(s) including all areas inside the building(s) such as: occupied tenant areas, common areas, meeting areas, break rooms, restrooms, elevator shafts, mechanical equipment areas, and storage rooms. Parking area includes open parking lots, partially enclosed parking structures, and completely enclosed (or underground) parking structures, which may be free standing or physically connected to the property. |
| Year Built:	| The year in which the property was constructed. |
| Number of Buildings:	| The total number of buildings that are located on a multi-building property. |
| Philadelphia Building ID:	| Same as Office of Property Assessment (OPA) ID number. |
| British Thermal Units (Btu):	| A unit of energy, which can represent both thermal energy and electricity. One BTU is the amount of energy required to raise one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit.  Portfolio Manager automatically converts kilowatt hour to Btu. |
| Electricity Use - Grid Purchase and Generated from Onsite Renewable Systems (kBtu):	| Annual electricity consumption for the property from the grid (reported from utility bills) plus the total amount energy produced from onsite solar panels or wind turbines (if applicable).  |
| Natural Gas Use (kBtu):	| Annual natural gas consumption for the property as reported from utility bills. |
| Fuel Oil #2 Use (kBtu):	| Annual heating oil consumption for the property as reported from utility bills. |
| District Steam Use (kBtu)	| Annual district steam consumption for the property as reported from utility bills. |
| ENERGY STAR Score:	| The 1-100 ENERGY STAR score was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and provides a metric for comparison with other similar buildings across the country. The score accounts for differences in climate, occupancy and operating hours. A score of 50 represents median energy performance, while a score of 75 or better indicates a building is a top performer. |
| Energy Use Intensity (EUI): 	| The metric used for comparing buildings in Portfolio Manager, EUI expresses a building’s energy use relative to its size. It is expressed as kBtu/ft², and is calculated by taking the total energy consumed in a year (kBtu) and divided by the floor area of the building  (ft²).  |
| Site EUI (kBtu/ft²): | Site Energy is the annual amount of all the energy a property consumes on-site divided by property floor area. |
| Source EUI (kBtu/ft²):	| The total amount of all the raw fuel consumed on-site, including losses that take place during generation, transmission, and distribution of the energy divided by property floor area. |
| Water Use-all sources (kgal):	| The annual consumption of water associated, across all water meters of all types represented in thousand gallons (kgal). |
| Total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions (MtCO2e):	| The annual carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases released into the atmosphere as a result of energy consumption at the property. GHG emissions are expressed in metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), a universal unit of measure that combines the quantity and global warming potential of each greenhouse gas. |
| Notes:	| Additional information on building provided by building owners or operators. |
