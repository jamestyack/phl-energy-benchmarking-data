##Energy Benchmarking Data (City-owned buildings)

##Summary
Updated data on energy usage for City-owned buildings for years 2011, 2012 and 2013.

This data complements the previously released dataset for all building over 10k sq ft which was [released in January](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/phl-energy-benchmarking-data-2011)

This data only contains information regarding municipal buildings, and is a subset of a larger energy compliance data set regarding Large Commercial Buildings. Both files contain most of the same fields.

##Definitions & Details
The "Custom Property ID 1 - ID" field within this dataset coordinates with Asset IDs found within in the data set for City buildings: http://www.opendataphilly.org/opendata/resource/252/city-building-locations/
 
Data definitions can be found at Energy Star's FAQs section:
